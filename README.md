# Exploring-Ebay-Car-Sales-Data-in-Python
In this project, we will display our Data Cleaning Skills. Cleaning a dataset is vital before analyzing the dataset because unwanted noise are presents in majority of datasets that we encounter on the internet. Not to mention datasets that includes human entered various contains inconsistency that will make our Analyzation useless. To prevent this, Data Scientist / Analyst spent 80% of the work cleaning the dataset that will ensure all of the values in the datasets are ready for analyzing.

In this project, we'll work with a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a [classifieds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_advertising) section of the German eBay website.

The dataset was originally scraped and uploaded to Kaggle. We've made a few modifications from the original dataset that was uploaded to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/orgesleka/used-cars-database/data):

- Sampled 50,000 data points from the full dataset, to ensure the code runs quickly in the hosted environment
- Dirtied the dataset a bit to more closely resemble what would be expect from a scraped dataset (the version uploaded to Kaggle was cleaned to be easier to work with)
